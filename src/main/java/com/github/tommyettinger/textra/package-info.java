/**
 * The entirety of textramode is in this package; {@link com.github.tommyettinger.textra.Font} is the bulk of this.
 * With Font, you can convert marked-up text into {@link com.github.tommyettinger.textra.Layout} objects (themselves
 * sequences of {@link com.github.tommyettinger.textra.Line}), and render those Layouts later. TextraLabel is also here;
 * it is an early version of a scene2d.ui widget using Font instead of libGDX's BitmapFont.
